## FLICKIES

### GOAL

Welcome to Flickies. This is a standalone project made for [General Assembly Instructor Challenge ](https://github.com/rachlim/wdi-instructor-challenge).
Flickies also run publicly in [heroku](https://powerful-ocean-29922.herokuapp.com/).

#### Installing Locally

- I've removed the ruby-backend-starter-code for clarity sake
- To install all the required packages, run:
```javascript
    npm install
```
- Sip a coffee and proceed to run the app

#### Running Locally

* Run:
```javascript
    npm start
```
* If that doesn't work somehow cos you're using windows. Run:
```javascript
    node ./bin/www
```
* Go to http://localhost:3000/
* Sip a coffee and **VOILA**, you have your personal FLICKIES
* p.s. if it happened you need to run on a different port. Edit the www file under bin folder. You should know what to edit.
  
#### Testing Locally

* Run:
```javascript
    npm test
```
* p.s. Test running on real-time, don't want that? You can also run this instead
* ```javascript
    node test.js
  ```

#### Notes

* I didn't us vanilla javascript on the front end side of the codes, as I don't think I can deliver on time. Please embrace jQuery, I think it's commonly used and easier to understand for beginners.
* The site is best run on the latest chrome browser ~~, that's always the case.~~

#### Stacks

* Express.js
* [body-parser](https://github.com/expressjs/body-parser) 
* [supertest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/supertest)
* [mocha](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mocha)
